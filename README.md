After upgrading the game to version 1.55, playing ETS2 (Euro Truck Simulator 2) will be very laggy and unplayable, typically dropping to single-digit FPS. The solution is to open the settings within ETS2, uninstall the SDK (Development Tools), then reinstall it. After this, performance should return to normal.

 Solemn Announcement on the Embezzlement of ETS2LA Official Tutorial in China
 To all members of the ETS2LA community and related video platform bloggers:
 Recently, we found that the Douyin platform Zhang Ze openly stole the official tutorial of ETS2LA China without any authorization, and spread its content marked with itself in the ETS2LA communication group established by himself.

 We clearly point out that the official tutorial of ETS2LA in China was carefully prepared by the management team members with a lot of time and energy, combined with the software development process and the actual situation of Chinese users, aiming at providing clear and accurate instructions for the installation and use of ETS2LA for the majority of European truck simulation 2 players.  The intellectual property rights of these tutorials belong to the ETS2LA China team.
 
 The blogger's embezzlement not only seriously violated the intellectual property rights of ETS2LA China management team, but also openly trampled on the labor achievements of the originators.  It is shameful and unacceptable to grab the achievements of others by illegal means and use them to build personal social circles and attract traffic.
 
 After the management team members discovered the blogger's infringement, they immediately communicated with him and asked him to stop the infringement immediately.  However, the blogger not only stole facts from deny stoutly, but also adopted a bad attitude of refusing to communicate and ignoring evidence.
 
 Here, the management team of ETS2LA China strongly denounces the blogger's behavior and puts forward the following solemn statement and requirements:
 
 Immediately stop the infringement: The blogger must immediately stop spreading the stolen ETS2LA official tutorial in China on any platform in any form.
 Public apology: The blogger must publicly and formally apologize to the ETS2LA China management team and all community members for his embezzlement in all relevant video platform accounts and ETS2LA communication groups, so as to clarify the facts and eliminate the adverse effects.
 Reserving the right to pursue: We reserve the right to further pursue the relevant legal responsibilities of the blogger.
 
 As an open and shared community project, the development of ETS2LA can not be separated from the selfless dedication and respect for intellectual property rights of each member.  We welcome and encourage players and content creators to communicate and create based on ETS2LA, but this does not mean that we can ignore the rules and infringe on the legitimate rights and interests of others.  A healthy and orderly community environment needs to be maintained by each of us.
 
 Once again, we urge the blogger to face up to his mistakes and respond responsibly to our requests.  At the same time, we also call on community members to jointly supervise and resist any form of theft and infringement, and jointly create a good community atmosphere that respects originality and encourages sharing.
 
 It is hereby announced!
